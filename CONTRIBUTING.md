## Setting up your dev environment

`lembas-core` uses `poetry` for dependency management.
Please see the [Poetry install guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for notes on installing `poetry`.

Once you have `poetry` installed, you can run `poetry install` to setup a virtual environment and install the dev dependencies.

If you would like to run the examples, run `poetry install --extras examples`.
